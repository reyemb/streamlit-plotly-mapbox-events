    Parameters
    ----------
    plot_fig: Plotly Figure
        Plotly figure that we want to render in Streamlit
    click_event: boolean, default: True
        Watch for click events on plot and return point data when triggered
    select_event: boolean, default: False
        Watch for select events on plot and return point data when triggered
    hover_event: boolean, default: False
        Watch for hover events on plot and return point data when triggered
    relayout_event: boolean, default: False
        Watch for relayout events and returns the raw data and lat,lon,zoom
    override_height: int, default: 450
        Integer to override component height.  Defaults to 450 (px)
    override_width: string, default: '100%'
        String (or integer) to override width.  Defaults to 100% (whole width of iframe)
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple consisting of list or dictionary

        events will be returned ordered
            1. Click Event
            2. Select Event
            3. Hover Event
            4. Relayout Event

        For selected, click and hoverevents:
        List of dictionaries containing marker details (in case multiple overlapping
        marker have been clicked/selected/hovereed).

        Details can be found here:
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data

                pointIndex: (index of selected point)
            }

        For relayout event

        Only a dictionary will be returned
